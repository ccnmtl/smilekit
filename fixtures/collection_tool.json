(2) Try gradually diluting the liquid in the bottle with water until there is only water in the bottle.  \r\n(3) Also try to take it away slowly such as half an ounce out a day until it is gone then it can be taken away completely. \r\n(4) If the child is having multiple bottles per day, take one bottle away at a time. \r\n(5) If the baby is already a toddler and goes to bed with a bottle, explain that he/she is too big to have a bottle in bed anymore.\r\n\r\nChildren may have a hard time learning to sleep without it but eventually they will get the hang of it.

If possible, kids picking out their own toothbrush may help get them excited about it. \r\n\r\nFor infants without teeth, gums should be wiped with a clean, damp cloth.  When teeth start to come in, parents should switch to a small soft toothbrush.  For children under 2- only a thin film of toothpaste should be used. For children over 2- a pea-sized amount of toothpaste should be used. Parents should supervise brushing until their child is 6-7 years old (Being able to tie own shoes and coloring within the lines are good markers.)  Most young children can hold and move a brush in their mouths BUT, they usually do a very poor job of brushing their teeth.  Brushing should be a family routine where the parent allows child to brush their teeth on their own with the parent \u201cchecking how they did\u201d by brushing their teeth an additional time.  \r\n",

Wipe teeth with a damp cloth after feeding. There are several techniques to try to wean a child from the bottle.  (1) Try giving a child the bottle in the living room with the family, then brush their teeth, go to their room and read, sing, and rock. This makes the baby not dependent on the bottle as a sleep crutch. (2) Try gradually diluting the liquid in the bottle with water until there is only water in the bottle.  (2) Also try to take it away slowly such as half an ounce out a day until it is gone then it can be taken away completely. (3) If the child is having multiple bottles per day, take one bottle away at a time. (4) If the baby is already a toddler and goes to bed with a bottle, explain that he/she is too big to have a bottle in bed anymore.\r\n\r\nChildren may have a hard time learning to sleep without it but eventually they will get the hang of it.  This may not be an easy or fast transition.  It may take days, weeks or even longer for the baby to give up the bottle in bed, but the mother needs to remain consistent in her actions.\r\n",
